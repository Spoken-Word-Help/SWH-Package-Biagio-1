**Spoken Word Help Package**

## First Package

```yml
Name: First Package
Group: (none)
Contents:
  The first package is starting with Lakota language content related to
  environmental science projects such as the Sicangu Climate Center and ESIIL.
```

This is the first package.

The goal is to experiment with data formats that incorporate community traction
and adoption features such as usefulness, flexibility, and adaptability while 
maintaining some level of technical quality.

I am also working on open-source tools to help work with the data.

This is a data-first and community approach for helping with spoken language 
learning technology.
