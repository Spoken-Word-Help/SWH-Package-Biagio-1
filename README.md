**Spoken Word Help Package**

## First Package

```yml
Name: First Package
Group: (none)
Contents:
  I am starting out with Lakota language content related to environmental
  science projects like the Sicangu Climate Center and ESIIL.
```

This is the first package.

The goal is to experiment with data formats (and offer open-source tools to
help work with the data). 

This is a data-first (and community) approach for helping with spoken language 
learning technology.
